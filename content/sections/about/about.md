I'm glad you found me! 

I'm born and raised in Las Vegas. Still figuring out if that's a good or bad thing. 

My family and I are on the path to greener adventures in Colorado this year. Although I spend my day behind the screen, any other moment is spent outside. Find me snowboarding, hiking, camping and maybe back behind another screen dabbling in video games. 

I have a passion for technology, and can operate in both front-end and back-end work. I enjoy developing solutions for every day digital challenges that businesses face. I focus on the experience, both how a customer <i>and</i> business will use what we've built. Intuitive. Elegant. Simplistic. 

I've worn a lot of professional hats in my life, and that experience has helped me see digital products from multiple angles. I'm diligent, focused, a great communicator and I love to collaborate. How do you create something that drives traffic and conversion, looks appealing and intuitive for customers and behind the scenes runs smoothly and doesn't crash? 

Reach out and I'll show you how.
